# XAI_Drift_Detection
DETECTING ADVERSARIAL MANIPULATION VIA ATTRIBUTION DRIFT.
=========================================================

# Explanation Drift in IDS (CICIDS2018)

Goal: quantify how explanations (Integrated Gradients) change under distribution shift / adversarial stress, and evaluate explanation-drift separability using ROC-AUC.

## Repo Contract
This repo is intentionally scaffolded. Student team must implement the stubs in `src/` to satisfy the end-to-end run.

## Setup
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
